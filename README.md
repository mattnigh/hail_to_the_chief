# Hail to the Chief
### An Open Source Playbook for Chief of Staffs
**Repo intent:** To assist those in a technology/engineering Chief of Staff (CoS) role. Over time I am hoping to grow it to a larger open source CoS career roadmap and guide. It was inspired by other repos - such as:
* https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-engineering-team-management
* https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
* https://github.com/shahedbd/awesome-project-management

### :blue_book: How to use this document
- Applying these processes in reality is much more complex, with more variables to consider.
- Everything listed below are simple patterns and resources to leverage.
- I stripped processes below to a MVP (or Alpha). To that reveals the truth of their purpose/value. Build upon them appropriately.
- Ensure more variables (such as organizational change management, your team culture/standards, etc) are considered.

##  Patterns for a Chief of Staff

###  :mega: Learn to be your Principal's Proxy
- **Context**
  - This is the most difficult CoS skill to master. In this role you must publicly separate your own ideas/beliefs from your Principal. Make decisions you believe your Principal wants when in this role (rather than you). When communicating you should generally differentiate between what is your opinion versus your Principal's if there could be any question.
- **Example/In Use**
  - Simple phrases like "...(NAME)'s decision here is we are going to invest in this." when acting as proxy can be completely appropriate. In other times you might want to make it clear you are making the decision in their absence.
  - What you actually say will need to adapt to the context/situation.
- Begin to learn this skill by representing your Principal in the simplest of situations (for example org/team document reviews, facilitating meetings, writing/editing comms and docs directly for your principal). Provide the Principal with a FYI afterwards. They can provide feedback as appropriate.
- Do this for around six months or so (biz complexity impacts this), after that begin to get real depth in your org (see below).

### üè¢ Start to get depth in your Organization
- Review the different areas you and your Principal think you can impact the most as a proxy (after 90-120 days).
- **Idea:** What are the low context needed, but painful areas you could assist with optimizing. Examples of low-contex/high-learning actions can be hiring, communications, and facilitation.
- Select one to two of these areas and begin supporting (and replacing) your Principal.
- This should be a significant investment of your time (writing documentation, coordinating, building relationships, etc).
- Set informal time to build your relationship with your Principal (virtual lunches, meeting during offsites, etc).
- Set (less frequent) informal time with the Principal's direct reports.

### üè¢ Start to get meaningful breadth in your Organization
- Review/edit Principal's LT strategic documents (planning, communications, proposals, etc).  
- Define smallish/medium areas of contribution you can begin immediately within those (or across).
- Do this for ~ six months while scaling up your contribution/impact in those areas

### üìÜ Provide your Principal with feedback (individual and org)
- Set up bi-weekly or monthly meetings with their directs
- Find a way to engage skip levels as appropriate
- Develop a consistent methodology to collect and report back feedback
- Use both formal and informal feedback gathering mechanisms (conversations, surveys, etc)
- Track and collect that feedback over time; report against actionable improvements (demonstrate wins/gaps)

### üìÜ MVP Process: Creating a Rhythm of Business (RoB)
- List what is needed by HR and compliance (annual reviews, increases, etc).
- List what is needed from your org in the finance cycle (budget reviews/submissions, vendor spend, etc).
- List what is needed to lead and communicate to your org (town halls, AMAs, etc).
- List what is needed by your principal's leadership team (off sites, org strategic planning, etc).
- List what is needed by your principal (promotion cycles, company-wide strategic planning, etc).
- Combine these into a document and present it in multiple mediums (written and visual).
- Have this sync reviewed by a lot of people (those impacted) and collect feedback.
- Have a communication layer just for the RoB changes (to those impacted and public if possible).
- Have an async final review/feedback and make changes as appropriate.
- Ensure there is a feedback process to optimize the RoB.
- Implement....and iterate (give time to see changes).
